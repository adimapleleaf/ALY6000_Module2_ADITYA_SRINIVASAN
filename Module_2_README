# ALY6000_Module2_ADITYA_SRINIVASAN
This is the repository for the Module 2 Assignment for the ALY6000 course. 

1. Introduction
In this assignment, we will examine the BullTroutRML2 data set using R. We will aim to provide an analysis of descriptive characteristics of the BullTroutRML2 data set. This includes pertinent statistics including mean, median, quartiles, variance, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis, outliers etc. 
Then, we shall provide data visualizations which can help articulate the key characteristics of the dataset and explain the significance of the visuals.
Finally, supported by the data presented, we shall summarize the key points. 


2. Data Dictionary
Description: Assigned ages (from otoliths) and fork lengths of Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentis) from two Rocky Mountain lakes in Alberta, CAN before and after a regulation change.
Format: A data frame with 96 observations on the following 4 variables:
•	age: Age (from otoliths)
•	fl: Fork length (mm)
•	lake: Lake (Harrison and Osprey)
•	era: Era of collection (1977-80 and 1997-01)
Note: The historical (1977-1980) era samples were from before restrictive sportfishing regulatory regimes were implemented (in the 1990s) that led to changes in abundance and population structure of bull trout.
